# McDonald-Ordering-System
This is an ordering system that aims to impact restaurant customer satisfaction, a total revolution to how restaurants serve customers. This system allows customers to place an order from the convenience of their home or even their work place. On an order a customer selects options from the menu, provide their first name, specify the number of guests that are to be prepared for and the date and time of arrival for an order. The application is also equipped with interfaces for the restaurantâ€™s waiting staff and kitchen staff to view customer order details and carry out their functions to fulfill an order.
